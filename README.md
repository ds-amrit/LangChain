## LangChain POC

#### "LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It's believed that the most powerful and differentiated applications will not only call out to a language model, but will also be:

* #### Data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data

* #### Agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment"

This repository gives you a quickstart guide to work with LangChain and openAI LLM (Large Language Models).
